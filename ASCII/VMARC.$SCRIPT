ç          The  VMARC  program  is a data compaction and file archiving
ç          utility for VM/CMS.  It grew from a project to develop a re-
ç          placement for the CARD utility that would have similar  file
ç          packaging  abilities  coupled with superior data compaction.
ç          VMARC has three basic functions: PACK, UNPACK, and LIST.
 
ç          The PACK function reads ordinary CMS files and produces  the
ç          equivalent  file in a compacted form.  The compacted version
ç          of the file is usually significantly smaller than  the  ori-
ç          ginal,  and  therefore would occupy less disk space or would
ç          require less time to transmit through a network.  VMARC  al-
ç          lows  more than one compacted file to be written to the same
          output file.  The latter is called an archive; the  individ-
ç                                                _______
          ual compacted files are members of the archive.
ç                                  _______
 
ç          Although  compacted files may make economical use of storage
ç          space or network bandwidth, they are not directly usable  by
ç          applications.    The UNPACK function of VMARC reads archives
ç          created by PACK and regenerates the original files from  the
ç          archive members.
 
ç          The LIST function scans archives created by PACK and reports
ç          the names of each of the members.
 
ç          Two  data  compaction  methods  are available, both of which
ç          give very good performance for most  applications.    Method
ç          LZW  is  a  variant of the well-known Lempel-Ziv-Welch algo-
ç          rithm, while S2 is a string-pair algorithm.   The S2  method
ç          tends  to  produce  a  smaller result, but at the expense of
ç          about twice the execution time during compaction.  (However,
ç          there is no performance penalty when  uncompacting  S2  mem-
ç          bers;  the  speed  of  the two methods are comparable.)  The
ç          following compaction results are typical for the LZW and  S2
ç          methods.

ç          Since  there  are cases when neither of the two methods will
ç          produce a result smaller than the original, VMARC  offers  a
ç          compaction  option of STORE.  No compaction is actually done
ç          in this case; the original file data is written as-is to the
ç          output file with only some structural information added.
 
ç          In the initial phases of development of VMARC,  the  utility
ç          was  targeted  as  a replacement for the CARD program.  CARD
ç          has become quite popular within Bitnet because of its  abil-

ç          2.  Separate  archives (with identical BLOCK specifications)
ç              can be combined into a single archive by simple  concat-
ç              enation.    For  example, ARC2 VMARC A could be added to
ç              the end of ARC1 VMARC A by the COPYFILE command:
 
ç                COPYFILE  ARC2 VMARC A  ARC1 VMARC A  ( APPEND
 
ç          3.  Since  the output file name and type may be derived from
ç              the corresponding parts of the input file names,  it  is
ç              possible  for  multiple input files (specified by a pat-
ç              tern) to map into the same output file.  For example,
 
ç                VMARC  PACK  * * A  = VMARC A
 
ç              could map the files TEST EXEC and TEST FORTRAN  both  to
ç              the output file TEST VMARC.  When this type of situation
ç              occurs  VMARC  handles  it  in what would seem to be the
ç              most natural fashion.   The first time  a  given  output
ç              file is used VMARC obeys the APPEND or REPLACE option if
ç              specified.    For  the second and all subsequent uses of
ç              the output file, VMARC unconditionally appends.
 
ç          4.  Similar to the behavior of the TAPE command,  after  the
ç              last  archive  member is written to tape, VMARC writes a
ç              tape mark then backspaces over the tape mark.  The  tape
ç              file  has  end-of-file  properly marked, and the tape is
ç              positioned such that a second use of VMARC can append to
ç              the tape file.  If the user wishes  to  create  separate
ç              tape  files, it is recommended that the TAPE WTM command
ç              be used between applications of VMARC.  That is,
 
ç                VMARC PACK ... ( TAP1
ç                TAPE WTM 1
ç                VMARC PACK ... ( TAP1
 
ç              Whether one or many files are written, it is also recom-
ç              mended that two tape marks be  written  after  the  last
ç              file.

ç              action  for  VMARC  is  to purge the file from the spool
ç              queue.  If the input is only partially processed, either
ç              because  of  an  error  or because of a member selection
ç              pattern that excludes one or more archive  members,  the
ç              file  is  retained for possible reprocessing.  There are
ç              two ways that you can  force  VMARC  to  not  purge  the
ç              reader  file, even if it is processed completely without
ç              error.  You can change the characteristics of your  vir-
ç              tual  reader  to  HOLD with the CP SPOOL command, or you
ç              can specify the HOLD option to VMARC.  Either way, VMARC
ç              will not purge the reader file at completion.

ç          S2             The  S2 data compaction method is used.  This
ç                         method usually produces smaller results  than
ç                         the   LZW   method,   but  it  requires  more
ç                         processor time to produce.    (During  uncom-
ç                         paction, the S2 and LZW methods have compara-
ç                         ble execution speed.)
 
ç          LZW            The LZW data compaction method is used.  This
ç                         method  is  used by default if neither S2 nor
ç                         STORE are specified.
 
ç          STOre          Data compaction is not be used.  This  option
ç                         should  be used for those few cases where the
ç                         LZW and S2 methods fail to produce  a  result
ç                         significantly smaller than the original.  The
ç                         result  produced  with  the STORE option will
ç                         always be slightly larger than  the  original
ç                         because  of  the  overhead  needed  to record

ç          APPend         Allows output be appended to an existing  ar-

ç                         exist, it is created.  If it does  exist,  it
ç                         should  be an archive created by VMARC.  How-
ç                         ever, VMARC does not verify that  the  output
ç                         is a well-formed archive.  The only test per-
ç                         formed  is  that  the output file must have a
ç                         fixed-length record structure.
 
ç          NOAPPend       Restricts output from being  appended  to  an

ç              After each archive member is processed VMARC generates a
ç              trace message.  The message reports  the  member's  ori-
ç              ginal fileid and the number of bytes read, the number of
ç              bytes  written,  and  the ratio of the two.  The message
ç              can be suppressed with the NOTRACE option on the command
ç              line.  When packing, the ratio displayed in the  message
ç              is  the  compaction  factor; the smaller the number, the
ç              higher the degree of compaction achieved.  When  unpack-
