          ____________

          The  VMARC  program  is a data compaction and file archiving
          utility for VM/CMS.  It grew from a project to develop a re-
          placement for the CARD utility that would have similar  file
          packaging  abilities  coupled with superior data compaction.
          VMARC has three basic functions: PACK, UNPACK, and LIST.
 
          The PACK function reads ordinary CMS files and produces  the
          equivalent  file in a compacted form.  The compacted version
          of the file is usually significantly smaller than  the  ori-
          ginal,  and  therefore would occupy less disk space or would
          require less time to transmit through a network.  VMARC  al-
          lows  more than one compacted file to be written to the same
          output file.  The latter is called an archive; the  individ-
                                                _______
          ual compacted files are members of the archive.
                                  _______
 
          Although  compacted files may make economical use of storage
          space or network bandwidth, they are not directly usable  by
          applications.    The UNPACK function of VMARC reads archives
          created by PACK and regenerates the original files from  the
          archive members.
 
          The LIST function scans archives created by PACK and reports
          the names of each of the members.
 
          Two  data  compaction  methods  are available, both of which
          give very good performance for most  applications.    Method
          LZW  is  a  variant of the well-known Lempel-Ziv-Welch algo-
          rithm, while S2 is a string-pair algorithm.   The S2  method
          tends  to  produce  a  smaller result, but at the expense of
          about twice the execution time during compaction.  (However,
          there is no performance penalty when  uncompacting  S2  mem-
          bers;  the  speed  of  the two methods are comparable.)  The
          following compaction results are typical for the LZW and  S2
          methods.

          Since  there  are cases when neither of the two methods will
          produce a result smaller than the original, VMARC  offers  a
          compaction  option of STORE.  No compaction is actually done
          in this case; the original file data is written as-is to the
          output file with only some structural information added.
 
          In the initial phases of development of VMARC,  the  utility
          was  targeted  as  a replacement for the CARD program.  CARD
          has become quite popular within Bitnet because of its  abil-

          1.  When  appending to an existing archive, any value speci-
              fied with the BLOCK  option  is  ignored.    The  record
              length of the existing archive is used instead.

          2.  Separate  archives (with identical BLOCK specifications)
              can be combined into a single archive by simple  concat-
              enation.    For  example, ARC2 VMARC A could be added to
              the end of ARC1 VMARC A by the COPYFILE command:
 
                COPYFILE  ARC2 VMARC A  ARC1 VMARC A  ( APPEND
 
          3.  Since  the output file name and type may be derived from
              the corresponding parts of the input file names,  it  is
              possible  for  multiple input files (specified by a pat-
              tern) to map into the same output file.  For example,
 
                VMARC  PACK  * * A  = VMARC A
 
              could map the files TEST EXEC and TEST FORTRAN  both  to
              the output file TEST VMARC.  When this type of situation
              occurs  VMARC  handles  it  in what would seem to be the
              most natural fashion.   The first time  a  given  output
              file is used VMARC obeys the APPEND or REPLACE option if
              specified.    For  the second and all subsequent uses of
              the output file, VMARC unconditionally appends.
 
          4.  Similar to the behavior of the TAPE command,  after  the
              last  archive  member is written to tape, VMARC writes a
              tape mark then backspaces over the tape mark.  The  tape
              file  has  end-of-file  properly marked, and the tape is
              positioned such that a second use of VMARC can append to
              the tape file.  If the user wishes  to  create  separate
              tape  files, it is recommended that the TAPE WTM command
              be used between applications of VMARC.  That is,
 
                VMARC PACK ... ( TAP1
                TAPE WTM 1
                VMARC PACK ... ( TAP1
 
              Whether one or many files are written, it is also recom-
              mended that two tape marks be  written  after  the  last
              file.

          1.  When input is taken from the virtual  card  reader,  the
              disposition  of the reader file when VMARC has completed
              processing depends  on  several  factors.    The  normal
              action  for  VMARC  is  to purge the file from the spool
              queue.  If the input is only partially processed, either
              because  of  an  error  or because of a member selection
              pattern that excludes one or more archive  members,  the
              file  is  retained for possible reprocessing.  There are
              two ways that you can  force  VMARC  to  not  purge  the
              reader  file, even if it is processed completely without
              error.  You can change the characteristics of your  vir-
              tual  reader  to  HOLD with the CP SPOOL command, or you
              can specify the HOLD option to VMARC.  Either way, VMARC
              will not purge the reader file at completion.

          Previous  releases  of VMARC supported four additional func-
          tions.  These have since been superceded by options that may
          be used with the PACK and UNPACK functions.    However,  for
          compatibility  with  the earlier releases, VMARC accepts the
          older command syntax.  This support may be removed in future
          releases of VMARC, so users are advised not to depend on the
          older commands.

          S2             The  S2 data compaction method is used.  This
                         method usually produces smaller results  than
                         the   LZW   method,   but  it  requires  more
                         processor time to produce.    (During  uncom-
                         paction, the S2 and LZW methods have compara-
                         ble execution speed.)
 
          LZW            The LZW data compaction method is used.  This
                         method  is  used by default if neither S2 nor
                         STORE are specified.
 
          STOre          Data compaction is not be used.  This  option
                         should  be used for those few cases where the
                         LZW and S2 methods fail to produce  a  result
                         significantly smaller than the original.  The
                         result  produced  with  the STORE option will
                         always be slightly larger than  the  original
                         because  of  the  overhead  needed  to record
                         structural information.
 
          APPend         Allows output be appended to an existing  ar-
                         chive.    If the output file does not already
                         exist, it is created.  If it does  exist,  it
                         should  be an archive created by VMARC.  How-
                         ever, VMARC does not verify that  the  output
                         is a well-formed archive.  The only test per-
                         formed  is  that  the output file must have a
                         fixed-length record structure.
 
          NOAPPend       Restricts output from being  appended  to  an
                         existing archive.  This is the default.

                         tion is not allowed for punch or printer out-

              After each archive member is processed VMARC generates a
              trace message.  The message reports  the  member's  ori-
              ginal fileid and the number of bytes read, the number of
              bytes  written,  and  the ratio of the two.  The message
              can be suppressed with the NOTRACE option on the command
              line.  When packing, the ratio displayed in the  message
              is  the  compaction  factor; the smaller the number, the
              higher the degree of compaction achieved.  When  unpack-
              ing,  the  ratio  is the expansion factor.  When listing

              You entered more parameters on the command line then the
              VMARC  program expected.   For example, you may have in-
              cluded an input fileid when unpacking from  the  virtual
              reader.   Eliminate the extra parameters, then retry the

              ally is no point to compacting the VMARC  program  since
              the  original  is needed to extract it.  The program ig-
              nores any such request.  If you really, really  do  want
              to archive the VMARC program, copy the VMARC MODULE file
              to  a  file  named VMARCX MODULE.  Use VMARCX to compact
              the VMARC MODULE.

              VMARC  was  expecting to find a valid number immediately
              following a command line option such as BLOCK.  What was
              found is either out of range  for  the  option  (e.g.  a

              An option specified on the command line for VMARC (after
              the open parenthesis) is  either  not  allowed  for  the
              function  that  was requested (e.g., STORE with the LIST
              option) or in conflict with another option that  appears
              eariler  on  the command line (e.g. APPEND after REPLACE
              has  already  been  specified).    Correct  the  command
              options, then retry the command.

              VMARC  was  expecting to find a valid number immediately
              following a command line option such as BLOCK,  but  the
              option  was  at  the end of the command line (so nothing

          The  VMARC  utility  program  is available from a variety of
          sources, with the principal  distribution  point  being  the
          LISTSERV  server located on the Bitnet node RPIECS.  New re-
          leases and fixes are always posted to LISTSERV  first.    If
          you  have  access  to Bitnet you may obtain the most current
          version of VMARC by issuing the following CMS command.

        | <http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Garage/3246/>,  with
        | all updates including those before and after level 1.2.21.

          If you are interested only in the (executable)  program  and
          its  documentation,  you  can extract just the documentation
          from the archive using the command

          The  update facilities of CMS are exploited to manage source
          changes, so in addition to the base assembler source,  there
